# Code of Conduct for SE701 Group 5's Project

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and learning environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## As a SE701 Student in Group 5

We are all expect to have great communication skills, which includes the use of either Discord or Messenger
(Whichever suits best for you). This includes cases of being unable to participate for periods of time, 
letting the team know will aid in any future planning that may be done.

We are all expect to be actively participating in construction of this project. It is noted that we are all
students and we have other commitments. However, any contribution is good contribution, so long as you
have made significant impact in construction of the project. *One-Upping* is heavily *DISCOURAGED* as this
means that other members of the team will be unable to showcase their own contributions as you may overshadow
them. In the case of having plenty of contribution to the project already, you are expected to help push
others in contributing to the project.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Conflict Resolution

As the project grows there *will* be some conflict and debate as development continues.
However, this is not an excuse for *ANY* type of bullying. We encourage healthy discussion
as this helps everyone in furthering their own skill and the project's development.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting Kelly at k.blincoe@auckland.ac.nz. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
In the case of no reports being made early, any comments will be left in the final
TEAMMATES discussion as required by the course.
